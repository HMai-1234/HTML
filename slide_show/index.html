    <p><span style="color: brown;"> Thanks to everyone who made Fiddler on the Roof Jr. such a smashing success!</span> Afer all of the hard work on rehearsals and set building and promotion, it really paid off. I have gotten so many comments on your wonderful performances.</p>
    <p> I've started putting up a <a href="slide_show.html">slide show</a> of the production. Please feel free to download the files from the Web site. If you want high resolution photos on a photo CD, please contact me.</p>
    <p>Once again: <span style="color: brown;"><em>BRAVO!!!</em></span> -- Mrs. Juroszek</p>
